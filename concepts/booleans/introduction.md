# Introduction

Booleans in Rust are represented by the `bool` type, which values can be either `true` or `false`.

Rust supports six comparison operators: `==` (Equal), `!=` (Not equal), `>`	(Greater than), `<` (Less than), `>=` 
(Greater than or equal to), `<=` (Less than or equal to).

Rust supports two lazy boolean operators: `||` (Or), `&&` (And).
