## Rust Installation

Refer to the exercism help page at http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-rust.html for Rust installation and learning resources.

## Running the Tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once if you wish.
