# Topics

Some Rust topics you may want to read about while solving this problem:

- Traits, both the From trait and implementing your own traits
- Default method implementations for traits
- Macros, the use of a macro could reduce boilerplate and increase readability 
  for this exercise. For instance, 
  [a macro can implement a trait for multiple types at once](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39150216/implementing-a-trait-for-multiple-types-at-once),
  though it is fine to implement `years_during` in the Planet trait itself. A macro could
  define both the structs and their implementations. Info to get started with macros can 
  be found [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/macros/syntax.html) and 
  [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.7.0/book/macros.html).
