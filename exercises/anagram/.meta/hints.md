# Hints

The solution is case insensitive, that means `"WOrd"` is the same with `"word"` or `"woRd"`. It may help to take a peak in the [std library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html) for functions that can convert between them.

The solution cannot contain the word itself. Basically a word is always an anagram of it's self but for this exercise we don't care. This mean, given `"hello"` and the list `["hello", "olleh"]` the answear is `["olleh"]`
